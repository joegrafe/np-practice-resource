## Thrombosis Canada Clinical Guides

Thrombosis Canada provides comprehensive, evidence-based clinical resources for point-of-care thrombosis management. While robust and peer-reviewed, these are clinical guides (not formal guidelines) regularly updated for accuracy and applicability in primary care.

### Clinical Guides - Key Topics

**Anticoagulant & Antiplatelet Medications**
- ASA, clopidogrel, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs: apixaban, rivaroxaban, etc.)

**Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)**
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Diagnosis and treatment
- Pulmonary embolism (PE): Diagnosis and management
- Follow-up and duration of anticoagulation

**Atrial Fibrillation**
- Anticoagulation management in AF patients

**Cancer-Associated Thrombosis**
- Specific guidance for cancer patients
- LMWH and DOAC use with special considerations (GI malignancy, pregnancy, renal impairment)

**Special Populations**
- Pregnancy & thrombosis: Anticoagulation considerations
- Perioperative management: Managing anticoagulation in surgical settings
- Thrombophilia and thromboprophylaxis: Testing and prevention in high-risk populations

### Clinical Tools
- **Risk Calculators**: Wells Score (DVT/PE), CHADS₂ & CHA₂DS₂-VASc (stroke risk), HAS-BLED (bleeding risk)
- **Algorithms**: Perioperative anticoagulant management, thrombophilia testing
- **Mobile App**: Free offline access to guides and tools

### Additional Resources
- Continuing education events, webinars, and e-learning modules
- Resource library for professionals and patients
- Provincial guidelines (e.g., BC VTE management guidelines) reference Thrombosis Canada tools
