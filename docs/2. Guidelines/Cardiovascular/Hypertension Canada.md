## Hypertension Canada Guidelines

Hypertension Canada provides comprehensive, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for hypertension management. The latest 2025 update includes a primary care guideline with streamlined, practical recommendations.

### 2025 Primary Care Guideline - Key Highlights

**Diagnostic Changes**
- **New threshold**: Hypertension defined as BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (measured under optimal conditions)
- Emphasis on out-of-office BP assessment (ambulatory or home monitoring) to confirm diagnosis and detect white-coat/masked hypertension
- Uses WHO HEARTS framework for pragmatic diagnosis and treatment algorithms

**Treatment Targets & Pharmacotherapy**
- **Target**: Systolic BP <130 mm Hg for most adults (no specific diastolic target)
- **Initiate pharmacotherapy**: For BP ≥140/90 mm Hg, or ≥130/80 mm Hg in high cardiovascular risk patients
- **First-line therapy**: Low-dose single-pill combination from two complementary classes (ACEI/ARB + thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic + long-acting CCB)
- **Resistant hypertension**: Spironolactone recommended as fourth-line agent

**Lifestyle Modifications**
- Recommended for all adults with hypertension
- Integrated into treatment algorithms

### Development & Resources
- **Methodology**: GRADE and ADAPTE frameworks, AGREE II reporting standards
- **Multidisciplinary team**: Primary care professionals, patient partners, hypertension specialists
- **Comprehensive Guidelines**: "Living" guideline to be continuously updated, covering special populations (children, pregnant women, unique scenarios)

### Available Tools
- Full guideline documents and algorithms (downloadable)
- Patient/public guideline summaries
- List of validated BP measurement devices
- Professional certification programs, webinars, and educational resources
- Patient support tools for shared decision-making
