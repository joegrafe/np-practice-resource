## Thrombosis Canada Clinical Guides

**Resource:** [https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides)

[Thrombosis Canada](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/) provides comprehensive, evidence-based clinical resources for point-of-care thrombosis management. While robust and peer-reviewed, these are clinical guides (not formal guidelines) regularly updated for accuracy and applicability in primary care.

### Clinical Guides - Key Topics

**Anticoagulant & Antiplatelet Medications**
- ASA, clopidogrel, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs: [apixaban](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=APIXABAN), [rivaroxaban](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=RIVAROXABAN), etc.)

**Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)**
- [Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Diagnosis](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=DEEPVEINTHROMBOSISDIAGNOSIS) and [treatment](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=DEEPVEINTHROMBOSISTREATMENT)
- [Pulmonary embolism (PE): Diagnosis](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=PULMONARYEMBOLISMDIAGNOSIS) and management
- Follow-up and duration of anticoagulation

**[Atrial Fibrillation](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=ATRIALFIBRILLATION)**
- Anticoagulation management in AF patients

**[Cancer-Associated Thrombosis](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=CANCERANDTHROMBOSIS)**
- Specific guidance for cancer patients
- LMWH and DOAC use with special considerations (GI malignancy, pregnancy, renal impairment)

**Special Populations**
- [Pregnancy & thrombosis](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=PREGNANCYTHROMBOSISPROPHYLAXIS): Anticoagulation considerations
- [Perioperative management](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_guides?guideID=PERIOPERATIVEANTICOAGULANTMANAGEMENT): Managing anticoagulation in surgical settings
- Thrombophilia and thromboprophylaxis: Testing and prevention in high-risk populations

### Clinical Tools
- **Risk Calculators**: [Wells Score](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_tools) (DVT/PE), CHADS₂ & CHA₂DS₂-VASc (stroke risk), HAS-BLED (bleeding risk)
- **Algorithms**: Perioperative anticoagulant management, thrombophilia testing
- **[Mobile App](https://thrombosiscanada.ca/hcp/practice/clinical_tools)**: Free offline access to guides and tools

### Additional Resources
- Continuing education events, webinars, and e-learning modules
- Resource library for professionals and patients
- Provincial guidelines (e.g., [BC VTE management guidelines](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines/venousthrombembolism)) reference Thrombosis Canada tools
