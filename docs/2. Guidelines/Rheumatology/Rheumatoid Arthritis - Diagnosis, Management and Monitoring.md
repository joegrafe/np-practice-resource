**Resource:** [https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines/rheumatoid-arthritis](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines/rheumatoid-arthritis)

Comprehensive BC clinical guideline for early recognition, intervention, diagnosis, management, and monitoring of adults with rheumatoid arthritis, aligned with [Canadian Rheumatology Association](https://rheum.ca/) and international standards.
### Early Recognition & Diagnosis
- **Early RA Definition**: Symptoms <3 months; early intervention prevents permanent joint damage
- **Clinical Features**: Morning stiffness >30 min, painful swelling of 3+ joints, symmetrical hand/foot involvement, symptoms ≥4 weeks
- **Laboratory**: CRP/ESR for inflammation; RF and Anti-CCP for diagnosis/prognosis (seropositive RA has worse prognosis)
- **Imaging**: Early x-rays may be normal; serial imaging monitors progression
- **Early Specialist Referral**: Should not be delayed for lab confirmation when clinical features present
