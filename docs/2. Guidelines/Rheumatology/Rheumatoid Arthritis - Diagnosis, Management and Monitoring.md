## BC Guidelines: Rheumatoid Arthritis - Diagnosis, Management and Monitoring

Comprehensive BC clinical guideline for early recognition, intervention, diagnosis, management, and monitoring of adults with rheumatoid arthritis, aligned with Canadian Rheumatology Association and international standards.

### Early Recognition & Diagnosis
- **Early RA Definition**: Symptoms <3 months; early intervention prevents permanent joint damage
- **Clinical Features**: Morning stiffness >30 min, painful swelling of 3+ joints, symmetrical hand/foot involvement, symptoms ≥4 weeks
- **Laboratory**: CRP/ESR for inflammation; RF and Anti-CCP for diagnosis/prognosis (seropositive RA has worse prognosis)
- **Imaging**: Early x-rays may be normal; serial imaging monitors progression
- **Early Specialist Referral**: Should not be delayed for lab confirmation when clinical features present

### Management
- **DMARDs**: Early initiation (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine); combination therapy for some patients
- **Biologics**: Specialist use for poor responders to non-biologic DMARDs
- **Symptom Control**: NSAIDs/corticosteroids for flares (not long-term)
- **Multidisciplinary Care**: Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, coordinated regular reviews
- **Patient Self-Management**: Disease education, medication adherence, exercise, joint protection, lifestyle (smoking cessation, healthy diet)

### Monitoring
- **Regular Clinical Review**: Disease activity, radiographic progression, treatment toxicity, comorbid conditions (cardiovascular risk is doubled in RA)
- **Laboratory Monitoring**: CRP/ESR to guide treatment; routine bloodwork for DMARD side effects
- **Imaging**: Repeat x-rays as indicated for progression
- **Long-Term Surveillance**: Periodic liver, renal, hematological monitoring with DMARD therapy
