Welcome to an NP Practice Resource!

The goal of this project is to have a first-stop for nurse practitioners and students to see if any of our colleagues have already found a brilliant resource, guideline, or approach to a patient presentation.

!!! failure "Disclaimer: This website is for educational purposes only. It is not to be used to make medical decisions." 
	- Medical decisions should be made only with the  guidance of a licensed medical professional.
	- Medical professionals should use their own clinical judgement when assessing, appraising and applying all resources and material.

This will be a collaboratively built digital practice resource for Nurse Practitioners in British Columbia, Canada. It will be built on the github repository [joegrafe/np-practice-resource](https://github.com/joegrafe/np-practice-resource).

Building on the markdown (MD) format rather than googledocs or onenote allows us to have a notebook like experience in Obsidian that directly syncs with github and the website. It also saves our work in a format that can be transferred in the future.
