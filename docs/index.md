## Welcome to an NP Practice Resource!

### The Goal 

The goal of this project is to have a first-stop for nurse practitioners and students to see if any of our colleagues have already found a brilliant resource, guideline, or approach to a patient presentation. This will be a collaboratively built digital practice resource for Nurse Practitioners in British Columbia, Canada.

### The NPPR Ecosystem

Building on the markdown (MD) format rather than googledocs or onenote allows us to have a notebook like experience in Obsidian that directly syncs with the github repository [joegrafe/np-practice-resource](https://github.com/joegrafe/np-practice-resource) and this website. This future-proofs our work in a format that can be transferred or built on by others.
