	- Medical professionals should use their own clinical judgement when assessing, appraising and applying all resources and material.

??? info "The Goal"
	The goal of this project is to have a first-stop for nurse practitioners and students to see if any of our colleagues have already found a brilliant resource for our own personal practice resources. This will be a collaboratively built digital practice resource for Nurse Practitioners with an emphasis on British Columbia, Canada. 
	
??? info "Levels of Engagement"

	2. Medium: Participate on the github page in forums, discussions. 
	3. Spicy ![🌶](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tee/1/16/1f336.png): Have a onenote/notebook like experience on your phone/desktop that directly syncs to the website.

??? info "The NPPR Ecosystem"
	Building on the markdown (MD) format rather than googledocs or onenote allows us to have a notebook like experience in Obsidian that directly syncs with the github repository [joegrafe/np-practice-resource](https://github.com/joegrafe/np-practice-resource) and this website. This future-proofs our work in a format that can be transferred or built on by others.
