To provide colleagues and clinicians with the best experience, the NP Practice Resource can be installed directly onto a smartphone. This allows the clinical guidelines to appear as an app icon on the home screen and function even when the device is offline.

## For iPhone Users (Safari)
 * Open Safari: Launch the Safari browser and navigate to the resource site: [https://www.nppr.ca](https://www.nppr.ca)
 * Tap the Share Icon: At the bottom of the screen, tap the Share button (the square icon with an arrow pointing up).
 * Select "Add to Home Screen": Scroll down through the list of options and tap Add to Home Screen.
 * Confirm: The name "NP Practice Resource" will appear automatically. Tap Add in the top-right corner.
 * Launch: The stethoscope icon will now appear on the home screen alongside other apps.

## For Android Users (Chrome)
 * Open Chrome: Open the Chrome browser and go to: [https://www.nppr.ca](https://www.nppr.ca)
 * Open the Menu: Tap the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner of the browser.
 * Install App: Look for the option labeled Install app or Add to Home screen.
 * Follow the Prompt: A pop-up will appear asking if you want to install the app. Tap Install.
 * Access: Chrome will add the app to the home screen and the app drawer automatically.
 
## Why use the "App" version?
 * Offline Access: Protocols and pdfs are cached locally, meaning they can be read in areas of the hospital or clinic with poor cellular service.
 * One-Tap Access: Clinicians can jump straight into the resource without typing a URL or searching through bookmarks.
 * Full Screen: The app version removes the browser's address bar and navigation buttons, providing more screen space for reading guidelines.
