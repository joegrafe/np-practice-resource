Here is a curated list of **Assessment Resources** for your NP practice. These are tools that help you with the "Objective" part of your SOAP note—physical exam techniques, ruling out red flags, and functional testing.

This table is formatted for your Obsidian vault (e.g., `docs/3. Resources/Assessment Toolkit.md`).

### **Integration Strategy for Your App**

1. **Ortho "Cheat Sheet":** Download the **"Ottawa Ankle Rules"** and **"Canadian C-Spine Rule"** images. Put them in `docs/assets/images/` so you can show patients _why_ you aren't ordering an X-ray.
    
2. **Rourke Baby Record:** Download the **2024 PDF forms** (Weeks 1-2, Months 2-6, etc.) and store them in `docs/assets/forms/`. You will refer to these constantly during well-baby visits.
    
3. **Dermatomes:** Save a high-res image of the **Dermatome Map** in your app. It is impossible to memorize every single nerve root perfectly; having the map offline saves you.
