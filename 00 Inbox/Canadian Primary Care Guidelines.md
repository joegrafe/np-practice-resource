### **Action Plan for Your App**

1. **Do not link to the landing pages** if you can avoid it. Try to find the **"PDF Quick Reference"** for each of these.
2. **Download those PDFs** into your `docs/assets/pdfs/` folder.
3. Link them locally: `[Hypertension 2026 (PDF)](assets/pdfs/HTN_2026.pdf)`.

Here is a curated list of "Force Multiplier" resources for Family Nurse Practitioners. These go beyond standard guidelines to cover pharmacology, diagnostics, patient education, and practice management.

As with the previous list, this is formatted as a **Markdown Table** so you can copy/paste it directly into your Obsidian vault (e.g., `docs/3. Resources/Clinical Toolkit.md`).

### **Integration Strategy for Your App**

Since you are building an **Offline PWA**, reliance on live websites (like MDCalc) is risky in a dead zone.

**1. The "Calculator" Injection:**

Don't just link to MDCalc. Download the HTML/JS for the top 5 calculators you use (e.g., Creatinine Clearance, BMI, Wells Score) and host them locally in `docs/assets/calculators/`.

- _Why:_ They load instantly and work in airplane mode.
    

**2. The "Patient Handout" Archive:**

Create a folder `docs/Patient_Ed/`. Download the top 10 PDFs from **AboutKidsHealth** (e.g., "Fever in Children", "Head Injury Instructions").

- _Workflow:_ When a parent is anxious about a febrile toddler, you tap the file in your app, open the PDF, and can even **AirDrop** it to their phone directly from yours.
    

**3. Drug Cheat Sheets:**

**RxFiles** sells a "Charts" PDF pack. If you buy it, put those PDFs in your `docs/Pharmacology/` folder. It is faster than logging into their app.
