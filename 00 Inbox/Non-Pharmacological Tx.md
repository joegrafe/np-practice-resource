### **Integration Strategy for Your App**

**1. The "Epley" Video Archive:**

Vertigo patients often forget the Epley maneuver the second they leave your office.

- **Action:** Download a high-quality "Home Epley" video (using a YouTube downloader).
    
- **Store:** `docs/assets/videos/epley.mp4`
    
- **Use:** Embed it in your "Benign Positional Vertigo" note so you can show them in the room without ads.
    

**2. The "Exercise Rx" Pad:**

Download the PDF "Exercise Prescriptions" from **Exercise is Medicine Canada**.

- **Store:** `docs/assets/forms/Exercise_Rx.pdf`
    
- **Use:** When you see a patient with new hypertension, open this PDF and show them the specific recommendation (e.g., "30 mins moderate activity x5 days").
    

**3. "Pain Education" Scripts:**

The concept of "Central Sensitization" is hard to explain.

- **Action:** Save the link to **Tame the Beast** or download their infographic.
    
- **Use:** Use this visual aid to explain why their back still hurts even though the MRI is normal. This is a critical non-pharm intervention (Education as Therapy).
