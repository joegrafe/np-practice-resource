### **Integration Strategy for Your App**

1. **"Prescribe" Information:** When you diagnose a patient with a new chronic condition (e.g., Celiac Disease), open your app, find **Celiac Canada**, and email/text them the link directly from the consult room.
    
2. **Action Plans:** Download the **Asthma Action Plan** (Asthma Canada) and **Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan** (Food Allergy Canada) PDFs. Store them in `docs/Patient_Ed/Forms/`. You can print these or email them to schools.
    
3. **BounceBack Referral:** Keep the [BounceBack Referral Form](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://bouncebackbc.ca/referral-forms/) in your `docs/assets/forms/` folder as it is a high-volume referral for anxiety/depression.
